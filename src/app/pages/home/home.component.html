                We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God,
                became man without ceasing to be God, having been conceived by
                the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary in order that He
                might reveal God and redeem sinful man (John 1:1–2, 14; Luke
                1:35). We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ accomplished our
                redemption through His death on the cross as a substitutionary
                sacrifice, and that our justification is made sure by His
                literal, physical resurrection from the dead (Romans 3:24; 1
                Peter 2:24; Ephesians 1:7; 1 Peter 1:3–5). We believe that the
                Lord Jesus Christ ascended into Heaven and is now exalted at the
                right hand of God where, as our High Priest, He fulfills the
                ministry as Representative, Intercessor, and Advocate (Acts
                1:9-10; Hebrews 7:25; Hebrews 9:24; Romans 8:34; 1 John 2:1–2).
                We believe Jesus is coming again to judge the living and the
                dead (1 Peter 4:5; Romans 14:9; 2 Timothy 4:1).

                supernatural agent in regeneration, baptizing all believers into

                We believe that salvation is the gift of God brought to man by
                grace and received by personal faith in the Lord Jesus Christ,
                whose precious blood was shed on Calvary for the forgiveness of
                our sins. Those who die apart from this free gift of grace will
                experience eternal punishment under God's wrath in Hell.

                We believe that the establishment and continuance of local
                churches is clearly taught and defined in the New Testament
                Scriptures (Acts 14:27; 18:22; 20:17; 1 Timothy 3:1–3; Titus

                We recognize Believer’s Baptism and the Lord’s Supper as

                We believe that Jesus commands us to go and share the good news

                introduce and reconcile people to God. Everything we are as
                believers should come from the love of God that transformed our

                We believe that the term marriage has only one meaning and that
                is marriage sanctioned by God which joins one man and one woman
                in a single, exclusive union, as delineated in Scripture. <br />
                We believe that God intends sexual intimacy to only occur
                between a man and a woman who are married to each other. We
                believe that God has commanded that no intimate sexual activity
                be engaged in outside of a marriage between a man and a
                woman.<br />
                We believe that any form of sexual immorality (such as adultery,
                fornication, homosexuality, bisexual conduct, or disagreement
                with one’s biological sex) is sinful and offensive to God.<br />
                We believe that God offers redemption and restoration to all who
                confess and forsake their sin, seeking His mercy and forgiveness
                through Jesus Christ. <br />
                We believe that every person must be afforded compassion, love,
                kindness, respect, and dignity. Hateful and harassing behavior
                or attitudes directed toward any individual are to be renounced
                and are not in accord with Scripture or the doctrines of the
                church. (Genesis 2:24; Ephesians 5:32-33; Matthew 19:4-6; 1

                We believe in the sanctity of human life. God is active in the
                conception of life and the conclusion of life, in birth and in
                death. This truth imparts extraordinary value to every life,
                independent of gender, race, age, or health status. Those who
                hold to biblical creation must attach great worth to human life
                and will stand in its defense. <br />
                We believe the sanctity of human life as established by God the
                Creator and believe that such sanctity extends to all people
                including the child not yet born, mentally and physically
                challenged, and those who are at the conclusion of their life on

                Baptism is solely for the believer who has received salvation
                from Christ’s atoning work on the cross, made a public
                profession of this salvation, and become His disciple. Water
                baptism is the step of obedience for that believer to obey the
                command of Scripture. This obedience is a testimony to God,
                oneself, the church, and the world as a visual identification
                with Jesus in His death, burial, and resurrection. To clearly
                demonstrate this identification, a believer should be immersed
                in water in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This
                work, based upon repentance, gives a picture of the believer’s
                former life of sin that has been forgiven and put to death and
                the hope of our future resurrection (Acts 22:16; Colossians
                2:12-14; Mark 16:16; Matthew 28:19-20; Romans 6:1-18).
